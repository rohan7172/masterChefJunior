In a mixing bowl, mix together the butter and eggs, and then add the sugar and the vanilla stick (if you have some). Or, use a food processor to mix everything together.
Sift the flour and the baking powder into the mixing bowl.
Add a pinch of salt and some milk (half).
Then whilst it’s mixing, add the remainder of the milk.
Pour the mixture into the baking pan.
Take the apple and cut it in half, making sure to remove the seeds. Then, cut the apple into thin slices.
Place them in a radius design leaving the center clear.
Cut the apple into even thinner slices and place them in the center of the baking pan and create a flower. You can either sprinkle brown sugar on top before baking or after (like we did).
Bake in the oven at 180°C /350°F for 50 mins.
Serve and enjoy!
